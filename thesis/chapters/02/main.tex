\section{Reinforcement Learning}

% Agent & Env | mentioned before defined
\textbf{RL} (\textit{The science of decision making}) is a machine learning approach to teach agent how to solve tasks through trial and error interaction with a dynamic, unknown environment. Where it formalizes the idea that \textit{\textbf{rewarding or punishing}} an agent for its behavior makes it more likely to repeat or forego that behavior in the future. In contrast with other machine learning methods, the agent is not told the proper actions to take. Instead, the agent interacts with its environment and, upon observing the consequences of its actions, can learn to alter its behavior in response to rewards received. The goal of the agent is to maximize the expected cumulative reward. The main characters of RL are the \textbf{Agent} and the \textbf{Environment}. The typical interaction loop between agent and environment is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:agent_env} below.

\subsubsection{Agent}\label{Agent}

An agent is considered the brain which decides to takes proper actions and it is where the learning process happen and improve over time. Examples of the agents, a drone making a delivery, a robot learning to walk or Super Mario navigating a video game. The reinforcement learning algorithm is the agent. For the learning process, the agent observes the state of the world and based on that takes an action. The environment changes according to the agent's actions and it might also change on its own. 

\subsubsection{Environment}\label{Environment}

An Environment constitutes a world for the agent to act and learn from. 
To illustrate and describe the environment to an agent we have a \textbf{state} \(s\) which is a complete description of the state of the world, and sometimes an \textbf{observation} \(o\) a \textit{partial} description of a state, which may omit information. Environments could be the whole surrounding 3D space or 2D images from cameras for a real-world task like a robotic arm, or it could represent an entire virtual world or games from an emulator like OpenAI Gym~\parencite{brockman2016openai}. When the agent can observe the complete state of the environment, we say that the environment is \textbf{fully observed} (e.g. Atari games). When the agent can only see a partial observation, we say that the environment is \textbf{partially observed} (e.g. robotic camera in a navigation task).
Some of the environments can be found in this figure~\ref{fig:envs_examples}

\subsection{Markov Decision Process}

Formally, reinforcement learning can be described as a Markov decision process, An MDP is a 5-tuple, $ \left\langle S, A, \mathcal{T}, R, \gamma \right\rangle $ which consists of:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A set of all states \(S\), plus a distribution of starting states \(p(s0)\).
	\item A set of valid actions \(A\).
	\item Transition dynamics $ \mathcal{T}\left(\mathbf{s}_{t+1} | \mathbf{s}_{t}, \mathbf{a}_{t}\right) $ that map a state-action pair at time \(t\) onto a distribution of states at time \(t+1\).
	\item An immediate $ \mathcal{R}\left(\mathbf{s}_{t}, \mathbf{a}_{t}, \mathbf{s}_{t+1}\right) $ reward function.
	\item A discount factor \(\gamma \in(0,1)\), where lower values place more emphasis on immediate rewards.
\end{itemize}

Extra objects can be defined depending on problem setting:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\rho_0$: Initial state distribution
\end{itemize}

Markov Decision Process refers to the fact that the system obeys the \textbf{Markov property}: which indicates that transitions only depend on the most recent state and action, and no prior history, in other words, the future is conditionally independent of the past given the present state. $ p\left(s_{t+1} | s_{1}, a_{1}, \ldots, s_{t}, a_{t}\right)=p\left(s_{t+1} | s_{t}, a_{t}\right) $


\subsection{Rewards and Return}

The reward function \(R\) is critically important in reinforcement learning. It depends on the current state of the world, the action just taken, and the next state of the world:

\begin{center}
	\begin{equation}
		r_{t}=R\left(s_{t}, a_{t}, s_{t+1}\right).
	\end{equation}
\end{center}

The goal of the agent is to maximize some notion of cumulative reward over a trajectory.

There are two kinds of return, \textbf{the finite-horizon undiscounted return}, which is just the sum of rewards obtained in a fixed window of steps:

\begin{center}
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
		R(\tau)=\sum_{t=0}^{T} r_{t}.
	\end{equation}
\end{center}

Another kind of return is \textbf{the infinite-horizon discounted return}, which is the sum of all rewards ever obtained by the agent, but \textit{discounted} by how far off in the future they’re obtained. This formulation of reward includes a discount factor \(\gamma \in(0,1)\):

\begin{center}
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:2}
		R(\tau)=\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^{t} r_{t}.
	\end{equation}
\end{center}

The use of a discount factor is crucial as \textbf{mathematically} an infinite-horizon sum of rewards may not converge to a finite value, and is hard to deal with in equations. But with a discount factor and under reasonable conditions, the infinite sum converges.

\subsection{Policies}

A policy ($\pi$) is a rule used by an agent to decide what actions to take, it's considered as the strategy that the agent employs to determine the next action based on the current state. It maps states to actions $ \pi : \mathcal{S} \rightarrow p(\mathcal{A}=\mathbf{a} | \mathcal{S}) $, the actions that promise the highest reward.

The policy can be deterministic where it is usually denoted by $ \mu: a_{t}=\mu\left(s_{t}\right) $
or stochastic denoted by $ \pi:  a_{t} \sim \pi\left(\cdot | s_{t}\right) $
with the two most common kinds of stochastic policies categorical policies (discrete action spaces) and diagonal Gaussian policies (continuous action spaces).

A very important two key computations for training stochastic policies are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sampling actions from the policy, and
	\item Computing log likelihoods of particular actions, $ \log \pi_{\theta}(a|s) $.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Reinforcement Learning Goal}

The goal of reinforcement learning is to select a policy which maximizes the \textbf{expected return} ($ J(\pi) $) when the agent acts according to it, where:
\begin{center}
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:expected_return}
		J(\pi)=\int_{\tau} P(\tau | \pi) R(\tau)=\underset{\tau \sim \pi}{\mathrm{E}}[R(\tau)],
	\end{equation}
\end{center}

with $ P(\tau | \pi) $ as the probability distributions over T-step trajectories.
\begin{center}
	\begin{equation}
		P(\tau | \pi)=\rho_{0}\left(s_{0}\right) \prod_{t=0}^{T-1} P\left(s_{t+1} | s_{t}, a_{t}\right) \pi\left(a_{t} | s_{t}\right).
	\end{equation}
\end{center}

So the central optimization problem of reinforcement learning can be described as:
\begin{center}
	\begin{equation}
		\pi^{*}=\arg \max _{\pi} J(\pi),
	\end{equation}
\end{center}
with $\pi^*$ being the optimal policy.


\subsection{Learning Optimal Policies}

There are two main approaches to solve reinforcement learning problems: methods based on \textit{value functions} (Critic-only), and methods based on \textit{policy search} (Actor-only). There is also a hybrid, \textit{actor-critic approach}, which combines both value functions and policy search, where the actor and critic are both represented explicitly and learned separately. We will now explain these approaches and other useful concepts for solving RL problems.

\subsubsection{Critic-only: Learning based on value functions}
Critic only methods are based on the idea to first find the optimal value function and then to derive an optimal policy from this value function.  Value function methods are based on estimating the value (expected return) of being in a given state. The state-value function $V^{\pi}(\mathbf{s})$ is the expected return when starting in state $\mathbf{s}$ and following $\pi$ is defined as:
\begin{center}
	        \begin{equation}
	                V^{\pi}(\mathbf{s})=\mathbb{E}[R | \mathbf{s}, \pi],
	        \end{equation}
\end{center}

and the optimal state-value function defined as:
\begin{center}
	        \begin{equation}
	                V^{*}(\mathbf{s})=\max _{\pi} V^{\pi}(\mathbf{s}) \quad \forall \mathbf{s} \in \mathcal{S}.
	        \end{equation}
\end{center}

The optimal policy, $\pi^{*}$, has a corresponding state-value function $V^{*}(\mathbf{s})$ where it could be retrieved by choosing among all actions available at $\mathbf{s_t}$ and picking the action $\mathbf{a}$ that maximizes expected optimal value for the succeeding state.

In practice, the MDP is often unknown and the transition dynamics $\mathcal{T}$ are unavailable so the only way to get information about it is by interacting with the environment and observing rewards.
Hence, construct another function, the \textit{state-action value or quality function} $Q^{\pi}(\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{a})$ estimates the value function and derives an optimal policy. 
It is similar to $V^{\pi}$, except that the initial action $\mathbf{a}$ is provided, and $\pi$ is only followed from the succeeding state onwards:
\begin{center}
	        \begin{equation}
	                Q^{\pi}(\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{a})=\mathbb{E}[R | \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{a}, \pi].
	        \end{equation}
\end{center}

A selection of these approaches \textit{dynamic programming, temporal difference learning, eligibility trace} is used in order to learn these functions.

\subsubsection{Actor-only: Policy search}
Policy search methods do not need to maintain a value function model but directly search for an optimal policy $\pi^{*}$. This is only possible if the search space is restricted. Typically, a class of policies is parametrized by a real-valued parameters vector $\theta$, these parameters are updated to maximize the expected return $\mathbb{E}[R | \theta]$ using either gradient-based or gradient-free optimization~\parencite{deisenroth2013survey}.

Policy based reinforcement learning is an \textit{optimization} problem, we need to find $\theta$ that maximize the expected return~\eqref{eq:expected_return}.
Some approaches do not use gradient-like \textit{Hill climbing, Genetic algorithms}, but the common use is \textit{policy gradients}.


\textbf{Policy Gradients}: Gradients provide a strong learning signal to improve a parameterized policy. In order to compute the expected return \eqref{eq:expected_return}, averaging trajectories generated by the current policy parameterization is needed. This averaging requires either deterministic approximations or stochastic approximations via sampling.
Due to gradients cannot pass through these samples of a stochastic function, 
Hence we use an estimator of the gradient, known in RL as the \textbf{REINFORCE rule}~\parencite{williams1992simple}, \textit{score function}~\parencite{fu2006gradient} or \textit{likelihood-ratio estimator}~\parencite{glynn1990likelihood}.
Gradient ascent using the estimator, which is similar to the practice of optimizing the log-likelihood in supervised learning, increases the log probability of the sampled action, weighted by the return.

\subsubsection{Actor-Critic Method:}
Actor-Critic method is the combination of both \textit{value functions} and an explicit representation of \textit{the policy} as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:actor_critic}, where the \textit{actor} (policy) learns by using feedback from the \textit{critic} (value function). These methods trade-off variance reduction of policy gradients with bias introduction from value function methods.

\section{Deep Reinforcement Learning}

A recent breakthrough in deep learning fields relied on efficiently training a deep neural network on large training datasets, which improves many fields including \textit{computer vision and speech recognition}. These models are trained directly from raw inputs using stochastic gradient descent to update the networks' weights. These successes lead its way to reinforcement learning in which it connects RL algorithms with deep neural networks to operate directly on raw images and efficiently generate training data using stochastic gradient updates.

\subsection{State of the Art}

In the following, we briefly discuss four state-of-the-art algorithms, \textit{Deep Q Network}, two deep policy search methods: \textit{Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient} and \textit{Proximal Policy Optimization}, also an asynchronous deep actor-critic method called \textit{Asynchronous Advanced Actor-Critic}.
These methods are currently the most popular and effective algorithms, proposed by DeepMind\footnote{\url{https://deepmind.com}} and OpenAI\footnote{\url{https://openai.com}}. In this work, some of these methods are used for experiments.

\subsubsection{Deep Q Network}
Deep Q Network (\textbf{DQN}) was first proposed by~\parencite{mnih2013playing}, it presents the first deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning.

Q-learning algorithm was used to make the decision, using stochastic gradient descent to update the weights. Since deep learning handles only with independent data samples, the \textit{experience replay} mechanism was used to break correlations along with \textit{Fixed Q-target}. DQN algorithm replaces the tabular representation for Q-value function with the deep neural network.

\subsubsection{Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient}
Since the rise of deep neural network function approximations for learning value or action-value function, deep deterministic policy gradient method have been proposed by~\parencite{lillicrap2015continuous}. It used an \textit{actor-critic} approach based on the \textbf{Deterministic Policy Gradient (DPG) algorithm}~\parencite{silver2014deterministic}, combined with \textit{experience replay and fixed Q-target} techniques which inspired by \textbf{DQN} to use such function approximation in a stable and robust way. In addition, a robust strategy in deep learning called \textit{batch normalization}~\parencite{ioffe2015batch} is adopted to scale the range of input vector observations in order to make the network capable of finding hyper-parameters which generalize across environments with different scales of state values.
The problem of exploration in off-policy algorithms like Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) can be addressed in a very easy way and independently from the learning algorithm. Exploration policy is then constructed by adding noise sampled from a noise process \textit{N} to the actor policy.

\subsubsection{Proximal Policy Optimization}
One of the main issues in policy gradient methods is defining the step size (\textit{learning rate $\alpha$}). Hence, the new robust policy gradient methods, which we call Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)~\parencite{schulman2017proximal, heess2017emergence} was proposed to solve this problem. It also uses some of the benefits from trust region policy optimization~\parencite{schulman2015trust}. these methods bound parameter updates to a trust region to ensure stability.
This algorithm is similar to natural policy gradient methods and it is also considered as a variant of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), it directly uses the first-order optimization methods to optimize the objective.

\subsubsection{Asynchronous Advanced Actor-Critic}
Asynchronous Advanced Actor Critic (A3C)~\parencite{mnih2016asynchronous} is an asynchronous method using Advanced Actor-Critic (A2C). \textit{\textbf{Asynchronous}} means asynchronously execute multiple agents in parallel, on multiple instances of the environment and all using a replica of the neural network (NN) (\textit{asynchronous data parallelism}). It often works in a multi-core CPU or GPU. The idea behind it is that there is a \textit{global network} and \textit{multiple actor-learners} which have their own set of network parameters. A thread is dedicated for each agent, and each thread interacts with its own copy of the environment.
Giving each thread a different exploration policy also improves robustness, since the overall experience available for training becomes more diverse. Moreover, in A3C just one deep neural network is used both for estimation of policy $\pi(s)$ and value function $V_{\pi}(s)$; because we optimize both of these goals together, we learn much faster and effectively. We also don’t need to consider the data correlation and oscillations issues because different agent gets different transitions when playing in the same environments.
