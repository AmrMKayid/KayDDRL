\chapter{Experiments and Results}\label{chapter:experiments}

This chapter presents the experiments performed in different selected environments. The selected algorithms with their configurations are discussed. We then conclude with the experimental results and discuss the goal and aim of the experiment.

\section{Distributed Experiments}

This section shows the conducted experiments starting from non-distributed based experiments until having a high-performance scalable algorithm and the multi-agent environment in the experiments. We start from the base experiment and compare the output results with each experiment.

\section{Transferability Between Physics Engines}

This section shows an experimental approach on how to transfer pre-trained agent from one environment to another different environment using different physics engine. Followed by transferring knowledge learned in 2D space into 3D space and how the agent will behave in the new environment.
