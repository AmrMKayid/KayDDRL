\chapter{Experiments and Results}\label{chapter:experiments}

This chapter presents the experiments performed in different selected environments. The selected algorithms with their configurations are discussed. We then conclude with the experimental results and discuss the goal and aim of the experiment.

\section{Distributed Experiments}

This section shows the conducted experiments starting from non-distributed based experiments until having a high-performance scalable algorithm and the multi-agent environment in the experiments. We start from the base experiment and compare the output results with each experiment.

\section{Transferability Between Physics Engines}

This section shows an experimental approach on how to transfer pre-trained agent from one environment to another different environment using different physics engine. Followed by transferring knowledge learned in 2D space into 3D space and how the agent will behave in the new environment.

\section{Benchmarking and Conclusion}

To conclude, we have performed multiple experiment to train, evaluate and test the effect of distribution and the possibility of using transfer learning to discover new environments. These experiments were performed on multiple environment and using state of the art algorithms. The most important metric which was the focus of the experiments is the total time to train the agent of the experiment to master the task and achieve the goal. The experiments were performed multiple times with different seeds to ensure we have the correct results and to evaluate the agents properly.

The following figure~\ref{fig:exps_time} shows the total training time that each algorithm have taken to perform the experiment.
