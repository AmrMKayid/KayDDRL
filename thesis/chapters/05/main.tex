In this chapter we summarize the information presented throughout this thesis and structure the conclusions with a work summary, limitations and future work of this study. With this, we provide a final closure to conducted reinforcement learning experiments, establish a relation between all the experiment results what is the benefit from executing them. Afterwards, with this conclusion, we also present the limitations we encountered during execution of our work and propose ideas to give a direction of further work that can be undertaken after this study. Finally, we end the chapter with concluding remarks for continuing further experiments.

% In this chapter, we summarize the work we have conducted and all the experiments and explain the limitations and remarks observed from the experiment. Followed by future work that might extend these experiments to large scale and complex environemnt. Finally, we end the chapter with resources used for the work.
